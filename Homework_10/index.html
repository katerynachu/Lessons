                    React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:

                        React Native runs on <span class="underline">React</span>, a popular open source library for
                        building user interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can
                        get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                        We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="weight700"> + components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
                        in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="weight700">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript
                        like so:<mark class="mark-grey">&ltText&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt/Text&gt.</mark>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The React docs have <span class="underline">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to
                        learn even more. Because JSX
                        is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <mark
                            class="mark-grey">name</mark> for the cat, name,
                        and embedding it with curly braces inside <mark class="mark-grey">&lt/Text&gt</mark>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="weight700"> + props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="weight700">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                        configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is
                        useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
                        your components memory!</p>

                        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that
                        takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                        function to be called when the text is submitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
