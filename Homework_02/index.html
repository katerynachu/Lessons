                <h3>FGlaciers and ice sheets hold about <i>69 </i> percent of the world's freshwater.</h3>
                <p>
                    Just over 96% of the total amount of the world's water is held in its oceans, according to
                    <strong>Water in
                        Crisis: A Guide to the World's Fresh Water Resources</strong> via the United States Geological
                    Survey (USGS).
                    However, that's primarily saltwater. To find the bulk of the world's freshwater you need to trek to
                    the poles, as 68.7% of it is encased in ice caps, permanent snow, and glaciers.

                    The best place in the world to see rainbows is in Hawaii.
                </h3>
                <p>If you're an avid rainbow gazer and want to get your fill of the beautiful phenomenon, look no
                    further than the state of Hawaii. A study published by the <em>American Meteorological Society </em>
                    in 2021
                    noted that the area's "mountains produce sharp gradients in clouds and rainfall, which are key to
                    abundant rainbow sightings." Air pollution, pollen, and a large amount of cresting waves also help
                    to put Hawaii at the top of the list when it comes to rainbow quantity and quality.</p>

                    <b>Whale songs can be used to map out the ocean floor.</b>
                </h3>
                <p>Fin whales are basically the <strong>Barry White </strong> of the ocean. The deep, bellowing songs
                    that males use to
                    attract mates are considered to be the loudest of all marine life and can be "heard up to 1,000
                    kilometers (600 miles) away," according to <em> Scientific American</em> . They can also be used to
                    sonically
                    map out the ocean floor thanks to the fact that the sound can reach depths of 2.5 kilometers (1.6
                    miles) under the water, which bounces back and provides researchers with accurate measurements.
                    Beyond that, a 2021 study in Science showed how using a fin whale's song can be far more useful and
                    have less of a negative impact on sea life than using a large air gun, which is the typical tool
                    researchers rely on.</p>
